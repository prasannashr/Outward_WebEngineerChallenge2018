	b. Navigate to /math and allow the user to input rudimentary arithmetic that is posted to /math for the output value to be displayed
		i. Example arithmetic
		1. 1 + 1 should result in 2
		2. 2 - 3 should result in -1
		3. 3 * 3 should result in 9
		4. 4 / 4 should result in 1
		ii. Nothing more than this is necessary, though bonus points for achieving more or without using eval/libraries
	c. Navigate to /game where you initialize Phaser/PIXI/Three.js/Babylon.JS and do something non-trivial
	d. Please commit the above into your own repository and forward along the commit logs.
